# FMB-Unity
a unity package to import Foursaken Media (.umb, .fmb, .fmb2) model formats using ScriptedImporter.
very work in progress. no support for animation or bones. still missing support for unpublished .fmb files.


MAKE SURE to group .fmb files with .fmd and that all textures are imported beforehand.

MAKE SURE to group .fmb2 files with .xml and that all textures are imported beforehand.


the current shaders are placeholders and will be improved over time.

fmd/fmb2xml may be moved to libfmb in the future.
